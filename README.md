# Python Music Player ðŸŽµ

A simple music player built using Python's `tkinter` for the GUI, `pygame.mixer` for handling audio, and `os` for file handling. This app allows you to select and play songs from a folder, adjust the volume, and control playback (play, pause, resume, stop, previous, next).

## Features

*Play, pause, resume, and stop music*
*Play previous or next song in the folder*
*Volume control with a slider*
*Displays available songs in a listbox*
*Simple and intuitive graphical interface*

# Requirements

3. *Install required libraries:*

   You will need to install the pygame library if you haven't already:

   bash:
